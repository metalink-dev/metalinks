          File Transfer Protocol RANG Command for Byte Ranges
                        draft-bryan-ftp-range-00

Abstract

   The File Transfer Protocol offers REST, to designate a starting point
   for a transfer, but does not currently offer any method to specify an
   end point.  This document specifies a new FTP RANG command to be used
   by clients to designate an end point for STREAM mode transfers.

Internet-Draft      FTP RANG Command for Byte Ranges       December 2010


1.  Introduction

   The File Transfer Protocol offers REST [RFC3659], to designate a
   starting point for a transfer, but does not currently offer any
   method to specify an end point.  This document specifies a new FTP
   RANG command to be used by clients to designate an end point for
   STREAM mode transfers.

   The current alternatives, without being able to specify an end point,
   are to issue an ABOR command or close the data connection.

   HTTP offers similar functionality with the Range: header, where a
   specific byte range can optionally be requested.

   [[ Discussion of this draft should take place on the FTPEXT2 Working
   Group mailing list, although this draft is not a WG item:
   ftpext@ietf.org. ]]


2.  Document Conventions

   This specification describes conformance of File Transfer Protocol
   Extension for RANG, and end point in a byte range.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   This document also uses notation defined in STD 9, [RFC0959].  In
   particular, the terms or commands "reply", "user", "file", "FTP
   commands", "user-PI" (user protocol interpreter), "server-FTP
   process", "server-PI", "mode", "Image type", "Stream transfer mode",
   "type", "STOR", "RETR", and "ASCII", are all used here as defined
   there.  The command "REST" is used as defined in Section 5 of
   [RFC3659].

   In the examples of FTP dialogs presented in this document, lines that
   begin "C> " were sent over the control connection from the user-PI to
   the server-PI, and lines that begin "S> " were sent over the control
   connection from the server-PI to the user-PI.  In all cases, the
   prefixes shown above, including the one space, have been added for
   the purposes of this document, and are not a part of the data
   exchanged between client and server.

   Syntax required is defined using the Augmented BNF defined in
   [RFC5234].

Internet-Draft      FTP RANG Command for Byte Ranges       December 2010


2.1.  Basic Tokens

   This document imports the core definitions given in Appendix B of
   [RFC5234].  There definitions will be found for basic ABNF elements
   like ALPHA, DIGIT, SP, etc.  To that, the following term is added for
   use in this document.


      TCHAR = VCHAR / SP / HTAB    ; visible plus white space

   The VCHAR (from [RFC5234]) and TCHAR rules give basic character types
   from varying sub-sets of the ASCII character set for use in various
   commands and responses.

   Note that in ABNF, string literals are case insensitive.  That
   convention is preserved in this document, and implies that FTP
   commands and parameters that are added by this specification have
   values that can be represented in any case.  That is, "RANG" is the
   same as "rang", "Rang", "RaNg", etc., and "ftp.example.com" is the
   same as "Ftp.Example.Com", "fTp.eXample.cOm", etc.

2.2.  Server Replies

   Section 4.2 of [RFC0959] defines the format and meaning of replies by
   the server-PI to FTP commands from the user-PI.  Those reply
   conventions are used here without change.


      error-response = error-code SP *TCHAR CRLF
      error-code     = ("4" / "5") 2DIGIT

   Implementers should note that the ABNF syntax (which was not used in
   [RFC0959]) used in this document, and other FTP related documents,
   sometimes shows replies using the one line format.  Unless otherwise
   explicitly stated, that is not intended to imply that multi-line
   responses are not permitted.  Implementers should assume that, unless
   stated to the contrary, any reply to any FTP command (including QUIT)
   can be of the multi-line format described in [RFC0959].

   Throughout this document, replies will be identified by the three
   digit code that is their first element.  Thus the term "500 reply"
   means a reply from the server-PI using the three digit code "500".


3.  Byte Ranges in STREAM Mode

   In STREAM mode, the data connection contains just a stream of
   unformatted octets of data.  Explicit restart markers thus cannot be

   inserted into the data stream, they would be indistinguishable from
   data.  For this reason, the FTP specification [RFC0959] did not
   provide the ability to do restarts in stream mode.  However, there is
   not really a need to have explicit restart markers in this case, as
   restart markers can be implied by the octet offset into the data
   stream.

   Because the data stream defines the file in STREAM mode, a different
   data stream would represent a different file.  Thus, an offset will
   always represent the same position within a file.  On the other hand,
   in other modes than STREAM, the same file can be transferred using
   quite different octet sequences and yet be reconstructed into the one
   identical file.  Thus an offset into the data stream in transfer
   modes other than STREAM would not give an unambiguous restart or end
   point.

   If the data representation TYPE is IMAGE and the STRUcture is File,
   for many systems the file will be stored exactly in the same format
   as it is sent across the data connection.  It is then usually very
   easy for the receiver to determine how much data was previously
   received, and notify the sender of the offset where the transfer
   should be restarted.  In other representation types and structures
   more effort will be required, but it remains always possible to
   determine the offset with finite, but perhaps non-negligible, effort.
   In the worst case, an FTP process may need to open a data connection
   to itself, set the appropriate transfer type and structure, and
   actually transmit the file, counting the transmitted octets.

   If the user-FTP process is intending to restart a retrieve, it will
   directly calculate the restart marker and send that information in
   the RESTart command.  However, if the user-FTP process is intending
   to restart sending the file, it needs to be able to determine how
   much data was previously sent, and correctly received and saved.  The
   purpose of the SIZE command, as documented in [RFC3659], is to get
   this information.


4.  The RANGe Command (RANG)

   A new command "RANG" is added to the FTP command set to allow the
   client to specify an end point byte range of a file from a server-FTP
   process.

   The syntax for the RANG command when the current transfer mode is
   STREAM is:

Internet-Draft      FTP RANG Command for Byte Ranges       December 2010


      range-command = "RANG" SP 1*DIGIT CRLF

   The numeric value gives the number of octets of the immediately-
   following transfer to stop sending at, effectively causing the
   transmission to be ended.  The server-PI will respond to the RANG
   command with a 350 reply, indicating that the RANG parameter has been
   saved, an OPTIONAL REST command with starting point, and that another
   command, which should be either RETR or STOR, should then follow to
   complete the transfer.


      range-response = range-ok / error-response
      range-ok       = "350" SP *TCHAR CRLF / error-response

   The REST command is intended to complete a failed transfer, by
   indicating a point to restart from.  The RANG command allows an end
   point to be indicated.  This allows a file to be transferred from the
   beginning to and end point, or when used in conjuction with REST,
   from a restart point mid-file to an end point before the natural end
   of the file.

   Server-PI and user-PI that support the RANG command ARE RECOMMENDED
   to also support REST.

4.1.  FEAT Command Response for RANG Command

   When replying to the FEAT command [RFC2389], a server-FTP process
   that supports the RANG command, as specified here, MUST include, a
   line containing exactly the string "RANG STREAM".  This string is
   case insensitive, and MAY be sent in any mixture of upper or lower
   case, however it SHOULD be sent in upper case.  That is, the response
   SHOULD be:


      C> FEAT
      S> 211-Extensions supported:
      S>  ...
      S>  RANG STREAM
      S>  ...
      S> 211 END

   The ellipses indicate place holders where other features may be
   included, and are not required.  The one-space indentation of the
   feature lines is mandatory [RFC2389].

Internet-Draft      FTP RANG Command for Byte Ranges       December 2010


      range-feat = SP "RANG" SP "STREAM"

4.2.  User-PI usage of RANG

   The user-PI issues the FEAT command to query the server-PI if it
   supports the RANG command.  In this example, the server-PI also
   supports REST.


      C> FEAT
      S> 211-Extensions supported:
      S>  ...
      S>  REST STREAM
      S>  RANG STREAM
      S>  ...
      S> 211 END

   Assume that the transfer of a largish file has previously been
   interrupted after 802816 octets had been received, that the tranfer
   should stop at octet 1000000 of the file, that the previous transfer
   was with TYPE=I, and that it has been verified that the file on the
   server has not since changed.


      C> TYPE I
      S> 200 Type set to I.
      C> PORT 127,0,0,1,15,107
      S> 200 PORT command successful.
      C> RANG 1000000
      S> 350 End Byte range at 1000000. Send REST or RETRIEVE
      C> REST 802816
      S> 350 Restarting at 802816. Send STORE or RETRIEVE
      C> RETR cap60.pl198.tar
      S> 150 Opening BINARY mode data connection
      [...]
      S> 226 Transfer complete.

4.3.  RANG Command Errors

   The server-PI SHOULD reply with a 500 reply if the RANG command is
   unrecognized or unimplemented.

   The server-PI SHOULD reply with a 550 reply if the RANG command is
   used on a file that can not be found.

   The server-PI SHOULD reply with a 551 reply if the server-PI is
   unable to deliver the file with TYPE I and MODE S.

Internet-Draft      FTP RANG Command for Byte Ranges       December 2010


   The server-PI SHOULD reply with a 552 reply if the user is not
   allowed to use the RANG command.

   The server-PI SHOULD reply with a 553 reply if the user requests the
   RANG of a directory, which is not allowed.

   The server-PI SHOULD reply with a 5yz reply if the specified end
   point is larger than the actual file.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This new command is added to the "FTP Commands and Extensions"
   registry created by [RFC5797].

   Command Name: RANG

   Description: End point byte range (for STREAM mode).

   FEAT String: RANG

   Command Type: Service execution/parameter setting

   Conformance Requirements: Optional

   Reference: This specification


6.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not directly concern security.  It is not believed
   that any of the mechanisms documented here impact in any particular
   way upon the security of FTP.
